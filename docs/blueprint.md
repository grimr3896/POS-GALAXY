## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) to create a clean, uncluttered interface that reduces eye strain during long work hours.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#E57A44) for interactive elements such as buttons and alerts to draw attention without overwhelming the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, clean, and highly readable interface, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist, clear icons that represent product categories and actions, aiding in quick navigation and recognition.
- A clear, tab-based layout separates major app functions (Checkout, Inventory, Dashboard, etc.), and should facilitate ease of use.
- Subtle transitions on item additions and form submissions for smooth user feedback.
